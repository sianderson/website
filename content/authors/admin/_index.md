I am a  <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-marine-microbial-ecology/">Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Marine Microbial Ecology</a> at the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. I work under the direction of <a href="http://ocean.mit.edu/~stephd/">Dr. Stephanie Dutkiewicz</a> examining phytoplankton thermal trait diffferentiation and evolution.

For my doctoral dissertation with <a href="https://web.uri.edu/rynearson-lab/">Dr. Tatiana Rynearson</a> at the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/gso/">University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography</a>, I examined the abiotic factors that shape phytoplankton communities. I employed experimental, molecular, and modeling approaches to investigate the role of temperature in driving phytoplankton physiology, community structure, and biogeography.
